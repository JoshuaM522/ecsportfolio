	  <ol>

		  <li>In 2020, I started playing comp bassketball with my cousin. I played for the Colorado Mayhem for 2 years. In 2022, I played for the Colorado magic for a year. I love playing basketball and football for several reasons. Both sports emphasize teamwork, which creates a special bond with my teammates. In basketball, executing a perfect play is thrilling, while in football, every player contributes to achieving our goals. 

The adrenaline rush during competitions is another aspect I enjoy, whether I'm dribbling down the court or sprinting on the field. Additionally, both sports keep me active and help improve my fitness and endurance. 

Finally, basketball and football teach me valuable life lessons about discipline and resilience, making each experience on the court or field truly rewarding.<a href="https://www.instagram.com/coloradomagicbasketball/">Colorado Magic Basketball</a></li>
